# **Integration Notes**

This document provides detailed instructions for integrating new features or enhancements into the ML-Scope project. It outlines key considerations, the current state of the project, and best practices for contributors.

---

## **1. Overview of the Integration Process**

- The ML-Scope project combines **real-time forecasting** and **reinforcement learning (RL)** to build a scalable, robust machine learning pipeline.
- Integration steps involve testing compatibility with CPU/GPU, enhancing modularity, and ensuring performance optimization.
- The project supports **dynamic quantization** for CPU efficiency and is prepared for GPU deployment.

---

## **2. Current System Features**

### **Device Management**

- The system automatically detects the available device (CPU/GPU).
- **Forecasting Models**:
  - **CPU**: Models are quantized dynamically using `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic` for efficient inference.
  - **GPU**: Non-quantized models are moved to the GPU (`.to(device)`).
- All modules reference a global `device` configuration from `forecasting_model/config.py` to ensure consistency.

### **Real-Time Queue Handling**

- The system integrates a shared queue for inter-process communication between forecasting and RL components.
- Includes robust logging for enqueue and dequeue operations, with detailed timestamps and durations.

### **Reinforcement Learning**

- RL training incorporates Q-learning with dynamic action and reward logging.
- The `rl_training.py` script supports test modes to facilitate experimentation and debugging.

### **Logging**

- Separate logs for:
  - **Queue Operations**: `queue_processing.log`
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: `rl_training.log`
  - **General Forecasting**: `base.log`

## **3. Integration Steps for New Features**

### **A. Adding GPU-Based Acceleration**

1. **Enhance Model Definition**:

   - Ensure the model supports GPU operations by verifying `.to(device)` compatibility.
   - Use modular device management (`forecasting_model/config.py`) to centralize device selection.

2. **Testing Quantization and GPU Models**:
   - Validate model performance on CPU with quantization enabled.
   - Compare inference times between CPU and GPU using the `generate_prediction()` function.

### **B. Extending Reinforcement Learning**

1. **New RL Algorithms**:

   - Add new algorithms by extending `forecasting_model/rl_utils.py`.
   - Ensure integration with the shared queue for real-time decision-making.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use `pipeline.py` to automate experimentation with new hyperparameter configurations.
   - Log results for comparison and refinement.

### **C. Open-Source Contributions**

1. **Custom GPU Modules**:

   - Add GPU-optimized layers or plugins in `open_source_contributions/custom_gpu_module.py`.
   - Document the purpose and usage of each addition in `integration_notes.md`.

2. **Collaborations**:
   - Encourage contributions by maintaining consistent code style (PEP8) and thorough documentation.

---

## **4. Testing and Validation**

### **Unit Tests**

- Add unit tests in `tests/unit_tests/` for each new function or feature.
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and invalid input handling.

### **Integration Tests**

- Validate inter-module communication in `tests/integration_tests/`.
- Simulate high-load scenarios using `resilience_testing.py`.

---

## **5. Known Challenges**

### **Quantized Models and GPUs**

- Quantized models are optimized for CPU and cannot run on GPUs. Use non-quantized models for GPU testing.

### **Real-Time Queue Synchronization**

- Ensure consistent data flow between forecasting and RL components, particularly under high prediction rates.

---

## **6. Future Enhancements**

- **AI Accelerators**: Test and optimize compatibility with specialized hardware (e.g., AWS Inferentia, AMD GPUs).
- **Distributed Systems**: Scale the pipeline for distributed training and inference.

---

## **7. Best Practices**

- **Logging**: Ensure all new features log relevant metrics in separate log files.
- **Documentation**: Add inline comments and update this document for any significant changes.
- **Testing**: Validate all additions using `pipeline.py` and resilience tests.

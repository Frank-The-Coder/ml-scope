## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**:

   - Click the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of the repository page on GitHub.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-scope.git
   cd ml-scope
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**:

   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Set Up the Queue Server**:

   - Start the queue server to enable inter-process communication:
     ```bash
     python forecasting_model/queue_server.py
     ```

5. **Run Unit Tests**:
   - Ensure the existing codebase passes all tests:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/
     ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** standards for Python code.
- Use `flake8` to lint your code before committing:
  ```bash
  flake8 .
  ```
- Keep functions modular and well-documented with inline comments.

### Branching and Commits

1. **Create a New Branch**:

   - Always create a feature branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```
   - Use descriptive branch names like `feature-hyperparameter-tuning` or `bugfix-logging`.

2. **Write Clear Commit Messages**:

   - Example format:
     ```
     Add: Implement hyperparameter tuning in pipeline.py
     Fix: Resolve queue overflow bug in rl_training.py
     ```

3. **Push Changes**:
   - Push your changes to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features and place them in the `tests/unit_tests/` directory.
- Use `pytest` for writing and running tests.
- For integration tests, include them in the `tests/integration_tests/` directory.

### Documentation

- Update relevant sections in:
  - `README.md` for new features or usage changes.
  - `docs/architecture.md` for structural changes or new components.
  - `docs/api_documentation.md` for API-level updates.
- Add comments to your code for clarity, especially for complex algorithms.
